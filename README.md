## features
- vehicleCode : unique code to identify a vehicle
- lat : latitude
- lng : longitude
- timestamp : timestamp in "Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second" format
- distance : distance from this data point to the previous one in meters
- del_time: time from this data point to the previous one in seconds
- velocity : distance/del_time
- weekday : day of the week
- journey : list of target places where vehicle is heading in order
- velocity_mean_5sec : average speed for 5 seconds
- velocity_std_5sec : standard deviation of speed for 5 seconds
- velocity_mean_day : average speed by day of the week
- velocity_std_day : standard deviation of speed by day of the week
- cum_sum : accumulative distance per course
- avg_total_distance : average total distance of course by vehicleCode
- left_distance : avg_total_distance - cum_sum
- time_cum_sum : accumulative time per course
- avg_total_time : average total time of course by vehicleCode
- now_state : departure + destination + vehicleCode
  - ex) if vehicle W53 drives from target1 to target2, then 12W53
- left_time : avg_total_time - time_cum_sum
